MSB and LSB
MSB -> Most Significant Bit as it has largest contribution. Right most bit
LSB -> Least Significant Bit at it has least contribution. Left most bit

1. ASCII Encoding
ASCII -> American Standard Code for Information Interchange
128 characters - 7 bit
Computer stores only 8 bit so MSB set to 0 and stored as 8 bit

2. ISO/IEC 8859â€“1
8 bit character encoding
Etension of ASCII and utilizes its dead bit.
Has support for English, Spanish, Swedish, Italian etc.

3. Unicode Consortium and UTF encodings
Unicode -> Universally Coded Character Set
UTF -> Unicode Transformation Format
8 bits were not enough

4. UCS-2
16 bit encoding -> 65536 unique characters
Similar to UTF-16 however can only represent 63,488 characters
2,048 characters are restricted by the Unicode

5. UCS-4
32 bit encoding -> 4294967296 unique characters
However can only contain 1112064 characters

6. UTF-8
8 bit variable length encoding -> 1-4 byes
ASCII characters will look same in UTF-8
Adds more code unit where ever necessary
Its is self synchronizing
HTML5 uses UTF-8

7. UTF-16
16 bit variable length encoding -> 2-4 bytes
If required we can add another code unit after 65535
self synchronizing
Not compatible wihth ASCII
Used less frequently
Has many cons
