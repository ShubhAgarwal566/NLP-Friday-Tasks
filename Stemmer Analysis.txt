Major Stemmers Used
Porter, Snowball (Porter2), Lancaster (Paice-Husk)

Aggressiveness
Lancaster > Snowball > Porter

Summary:

Porter
Most commonly used stemmer. It is least aggressive but still is very complex. Oldest stemming algorithm.

Snowball
It is an imporvement over the then existing Porter Stemmer. Slightly faster execution time than that of Porter. 

Lancaster
Most aggressive stemmer in the list. Stemmed representations are not very intuitive for this. Has a very fast computational time and can reduce working set to a huge extent. Prone to over stemming.
